# C++ Playground

## Introduction 

This repo just holds some random C++ experiments to evaluate various features of the language. Some of the samples are derived from external sources, which are credited in the relevant source files.

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio 2026 with the _Desktop C++ Development with C++_ workload installed. This is because some samples test features only recently standardised (such as modules and ranges), of which older versions of VS may not support. Once you have done this, simply open the `C++Experiments` solution and build it. Some projects collapse multiple samples to avoid having too many projects; simply modify the `main.cpp` file to adjust which sample to run.
